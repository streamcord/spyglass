Spyglass is a microservice implementation of the Twitch EventSub API, designed to efficiently create and manage
subscriptions. It's currently being developed for use with Streamcord, but could be adapted for use with other services,
and can serve as a reference for other implementations of EventSub.

## Status

Spyglass is currently in the pre-alpha phase of development, and has yet to be deployed in production.

## Building

First, install a JDK, version 11 or greater. Then:

```shell
$ ./gradlew shadowJar
```

This will create a file in the `build/libs` folder named `spyglass-indev-all.jar`.

## Setup

Spyglass, in its current state, requires connection to both a MongoDB replica set and an AMQP client. Set both of these
up first, then proceed to the next step.

### spyglass.yml

Create a file in the same directory as the Spyglass jarfile named `spyglass.yml`. This file will contain the
configuration Spyglass will use. It should be formatted as such:

```yaml
mongo:
  connection: <connection string for replica set, e.g. "localhost?replicaSet=replicaset">
  database: <name of db, e.g. "eventsub">
  collections:
    subscriptions: <name of collection, e.g. "subscriptions">
    notifications: <name of collection, e.g. "notifications">

twitch:
  client_id: <Twitch client ID, e.g. "yuk4id1awfrr5qkj5yh8qzlgpg66">
  client_secret: <Twitch client secret, e.g. "5j48e47jhzb55o7zainz7e7niist">
  base_callback: <Webhook callback URL for EventSub notifications, e.g. "eventsub.streamcord.io">

amqp:
  connection: <connection string, e.g. "localhost">
  queue: <queue name, e.g. "events">
  authentication: # optional
    username: <username to use for AMQP connection>
    password: <password to use for AMQP connection>

logging: # optional
  level: <tinylog log level. See https://tinylog.org/v2/configuration/> # optional
  format: <tinylog log message format. See https://tinylog.org/v2/configuration/> # optional
  error_webhook: <Discord webhook URL to send warnings/errors to> # optional
```

### MongoDB

Spyglass will only subscribe to events from Twitch if notifications exist for those events, and it uses MongoDB replica
set change streams to watch for creation and deletion of those events. Thus, the MongoDB instance used for Spyglass
**must be a replica set.** An error will be thrown otherwise.

To have Spyglass subscribe to events for a specific user, create a new document in the notifications collection set
in `spyglass.yml`. This document requires the following information *at the very least*:

```json5
{
  "streamer_id": "streamer ID, e.g. 123456",
  /* 0 if no need for stream-end tracking, any other positive integer otherwise */
  "stream_end_action": 0
}
```

In addition, the document must have a custom `_id` field to properly track notification deletion. This custom `_id`
should have a `BinData` value with the first 8 bytes being the streamer ID encoded as big endian, and the following 12
bytes being a normally generated `ObjectId` value's binary representation. To do this in Python 3:

```python3
oid_bytes = ObjectId().binary
streamer_id_bytes = streamer_id_int.to_bytes(8, byteorder="big")
doc_binary_id = Binary(streamer_id_bytes + oid_bytes)
```

### Reverse Proxy

Spyglass exposes an HTTP server on port 8080 without SSL, and Twitch requires that any webhook callback URL for EventSub
use port 443 with SSL. To bridge the gap, a reverse proxy service like Nginx or Apache can be used, along with a
certificate provider. You may use your favorite reverse proxy if you wish, but if you're not sure, we
recommend [`jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion`](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion).

### AMQP

Once Spyglass receives a webhook message from Twitch, it will take the important information from that message and send
it to an AMQP queue. The server that provides this queue may use authentication, but it cannot have SSL enabled unless a
proxy is provided to facilitate AMQP SSL for Spyglass. It must also use the default AMQP port.

Messages sent to the AMQP queue are encoded as JSON. The format of these messages is subject to change, but a version
field is provided to allow for changes to be made without breaking existing installations. The following are example
message values for the **v1** format.

#### Stream Online (op = 1)

```json5
{
  "v": 1,
  "op": 1,
  /* the ID of the user whose stream just started */
  "userID": 635369093,
  /* the new stream's ID */
  "streamID": 41313216413,
  /* the UTC time at which this notification was received from Twitch */
  "time": "2021-04-05T21:51:51.337883107Z"
}
```

#### Stream Offline (op = 2)

```json5
{
  "v": 1,
  "op": 2,
  /* the ID of the user whose stream just ended */
  "userID": 635369093,
  /* the UTC time at which this notification was received from Twitch */
  "time": "2021-04-05T21:53:24.449161198Z"
}
```

## Running

Spyglass requires two environment variables to be set, `SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX` and `SPYGLASS_WORKER_TOTAL`. These
variables allow for efficient load balancing by only handling a subset of notifications. `SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX` should
be set to the index of the current worker, starting at 0, and `SPYGLASS_WORKER_TOTAL` should be the total number of
workers.

The application will create an HTTP server on port 8080, and will send `https://INDEX.BASE_CALLBACK` as the webhook
event link to Twitch, where `BASE_CALLBACK` is provided in `spyglass.yml` and `INDEX` is the value
of `SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX`. For example, if the base callback is set to `eventsub.streamcord.io` and the value
of `SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX` is 0, then the URL sent to Twitch for event callbacks will
be https://0.eventsub.streamcord.io.

### Running One Worker

```shell
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX=0
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_TOTAL=1
$ java -jar spyglass-indev-all.jar
```

### Running Two Workers

```shell
# in one shell
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX=0
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_TOTAL=2
$ java -jar spyglass-indev-all.jar

# in another shell
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_INDEX=1
$ export SPYGLASS_WORKER_TOTAL=2
$ java -jar spyglass-indev-all.jar
```
